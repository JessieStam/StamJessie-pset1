Madlibs
Native app studio
Jessie Stam

This application lets users make their own madlibs stories. They enter words for every placeholder in the text, without knowing what
the story is about. The application then prints the story onto the screen.

Unfortunately, I was unable to finish this assignment, due to technical issues regarding the software and a lack of knowledge on my part.
I hope we can look into this during office hours. Because I didn't finish the application, I also coudn't make proper screenshots. The
screenshots you see here are taken from the Android Studio program and not from the actual application using an emulator. Despite my
project being unfinished, I hope you will take the time to look through my code and give me feedback. That would be much appreciated, since
I struggle a lot with writing code. Thanks in advance.
